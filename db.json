I was having a problem with new notes not showing up until I refreshed the page. \nI see that you were able to get yours working, but mine didn't, so it wasn't lagging. I researched it and it was a hot reload issue. So I had to add an .env file with FAST_REFRESH=false in the file and that fixed the issue. Posting this in case anyone else had this issue.",
